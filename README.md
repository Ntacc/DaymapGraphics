# DaymapGraphics
Currently, Daymap's UI is composed of a white background, a white foreground and gainsboro text. Daymap Graphics is an extension that allows customisation of Daymap.
Daymap Graphics is based on my earlier [userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/443619-daymap-graphics), which has ceased development in favour of the extension.
